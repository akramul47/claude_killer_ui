## 🎯 Key Components

### Audio Wave Visualization
- **Complex Wave Generation**: Uses harmonic series, golden ratio frequencies, and Perlin noise
- **Smooth Animations**: Multiple animation controllers for fluid motion
- **Realistic Gradients**: Prominent color fills for fluid realism

### UI Components
- **ConversationDisplay**: AI avatar with glow effects and message bubbles
- **ControlPanel**: Recording button with breathing animation and control buttons
- **FloatingParticle**: Subtle background particles with warm color tones
- **ShimmerText**: Animated status text with iOS-style shimmer effect

### Theme System
- **AppColors**: Centralized color constants
- **AppSizes**: Consistent sizing throughout the app
- **AppTheme**: Material theme configuration

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

- **Multiple Animation Controllers**: Background (8s), breathing (4s), glow (2s), wave (4s/5s/3s)
- **Custom Painter**: Sophisticated `AudioWavePainter` with mathematical wave generation
- **Positioned Layouts**: Full-width wave positioning with overlay controls
- **Professional Architecture**: Modular, maintainable, and scalable code structure
